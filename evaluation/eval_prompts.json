        "prompt": "What is photosynthesis and why is it important for life on Earth?",
        "target_response": "Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy (usually from the sun) into chemical energy stored in glucose. During this process, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil, using chlorophyll to capture light energy. The byproduct is oxygen, which is released into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth because it produces the oxygen we breathe, forms the base of most food chains by creating organic compounds, and helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, playing a vital role in Earth's climate system."

        "target_response": "Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE) was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and one of history's most successful military commanders. He became king at age 20 after his father Philip II's assassination. His major achievements include: conquering the Persian Empire (the largest empire of his time), spreading Greek culture across three continents from Greece to northwestern India, founding over 20 cities including Alexandria in Egypt, and creating one of the largest empires in ancient history by age 30. His conquests facilitated cultural exchange between East and West, leading to the Hellenistic period. He remained undefeated in battle and is studied in military academies to this day."

        "target_response": "Here's how to write a Python function to check if a number is prime:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    # Handle edge cases\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check odd divisors up to square root\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function works by: (1) returning False for numbers less than 2, (2) returning True for 2, (3) eliminating even numbers, and (4) checking only odd divisors up to the square root for efficiency. You can use it like: `is_prime(17)` which returns `True`."

        "target_response": "Let me solve this step-by-step:\n\n1) Train A starts at 9:00 AM at 60 mph. By 10:00 AM (when Train B starts), Train A has traveled: 60 × 1 = 60 miles.\n\n2) Remaining distance between trains at 10:00 AM: 280 - 60 = 220 miles.\n\n3) After 10:00 AM, both trains move toward each other. Their combined closing speed: 60 + 80 = 140 mph.\n\n4) Time to meet after 10:00 AM: 220 ÷ 140 = 1.57 hours ≈ 1 hour 34 minutes.\n\n5) Meeting time: 10:00 AM + 1 hour 34 minutes = 11:34 AM.\n\nThe trains will meet at approximately 11:34 AM, about 154 miles from Station A and 126 miles from Station B."

        "target_response": "Imagine you have a magical coin that can be both heads AND tails at the same time while it's spinning in the air—that's kind of how quantum computers work!\n\nRegular computers use 'bits' that are like light switches—they're either ON (1) or OFF (0), one at a time. But quantum computers use 'qubits' that can be ON, OFF, or BOTH at once, just like that spinning coin!\n\nThis is super cool because when you have lots of these magical spinning coins working together, they can try millions of answers to a problem all at the same time, instead of checking one answer after another like regular computers do.\n\nSo quantum computers are like having a million helpers solving a maze simultaneously, while regular computers have just one helper trying one path at a time. That's why they can solve some really hard problems much faster!"
